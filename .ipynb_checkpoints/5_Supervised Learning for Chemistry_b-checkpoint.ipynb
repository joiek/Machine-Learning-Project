    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is when the algorithm is given the answer (target) to learn from. Essentially, the algorithm is given in the input data, it guesses a solution to get a prediction (output), and this is compared to the correct answer. Obviously the first guess is wrong, but by comparing the prediction ($\\hat{\\textbf{y}}$) to the true answer, *target* or *ground truth* (**y**) the model can *learn* and improve its predictions.\n",

For example, the features may be a set of *fingerprints* (created from a chemical structure) and the target may be a molecular property, like atomic energy, solubility, or action against a protein target.\n",

    "#### Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression discussed here is exactly the same as that in notebooks 1 and 2a, however as the input data is highly multidimentional (often 1000's of dimensions), the fitted function is a multi-dimensional object, for this reason we do not plot the fitted function (as we did in the Linear_Regression_Cellulose notebook). Instead, we are interested in how well the model *predicts* the training set data, and *generalises* to the test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regression models can be thought of as fitting a function:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Classificiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification models assign input data to a *category*. For example, matching a molecular structure to the category 'active against HIV protein'. See notebook 4 for more examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generation\n",

    "Generative models produce new examples of the input after training. For example, you might train a variational autoencoder on molecular structures and then use it to generate novel molecular structures. \n",

    "## Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "When training an ML algorithm, it is common practice to split your data into 2 or 3 datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train: this is the majority of the data, and it is used to train the ML algorithm. \n",
    "2. Test: this is data that is NEVER shown to the algorithm during training and only used at the end to test the algorithm.\n",
    "3. Validation: this is data that is not used for training but is used to test the algorithm during training (validate the algorithm). \n",
    "\n",
    "The point of building supervised ML algorithms is not generally to describe your data, but to use the model in the future to predict **y** for new data. For example, in the IMPRESSION NMR prediction program [[]] input molecular structure is mapped to output chemical shifts. This is not used to model what the NMR is for the molecules in the dataset (as we already know that, we used it to train the algorithm in the first place!), but to predict the chemical shifts for an unseen molecule, for example, one that a synthetic chemist has just made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test set is held out and not used for training to get an idea how an algorithm will work on as-yet-unseens data. N.B. This is the equivalent of the leave-one-out approach used in design of experiments and regression models, only here instead of leaving a single datapoint out of a small dataset, we leave a fraction (usually 10%) out. \n",
    "\n",
    "As ML algorithms have such a large degree of power to fit data, they have the problem of *over-fitting*, where the algorithm learns to memorise the dataset, and this makes the algorithm less useful for generalisation. So, we use the validation dataset as a practise test set. The algorithm is tested on this dataset after every epoch of training, and overfitting happens once the validation set stops improving. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common splits for the data are:\n",

The random split results must be rejected because a random split can make the problem too easy if the dataset is not balanced (which this isn't) and the fact that it gives vastly better results than the other two methods suggests that the random split results overestimate the goodness of the model."
