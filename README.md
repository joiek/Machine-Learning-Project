# Machine Learning Project
 This is my final year Machine Learning Project. Different featurisation methods are used on the Tox21 dataset to train models which can be used to predict the toxicity of molecules. 
 
 The notebooks were made in this order to accompany my dissertation:
 1. SmilesToImage featuriser
 2. ECFP featuriser
 3. ConvMol featuriser
 4. Overall Results
 
In the 'Overall Results' notebook, the three featurisation methods were compared and the best featurisation method for Tox21 was determined here. 

The 'Manifold figure' notebook contains the code used to make the manifold plot in my literature review.
